Detailed Damage Assessment Data Input (Core of Winn Methodology):

Thermal Data: Fields for Thermal Load observations, dry roof status, moisture map mosaic, IRX Map. Input for emissivity settings. Ability to upload thermal ortho maps and flight plans.

Terrestrial Walk Data:

Labeling of buildings/roof sections (e.g., #1, #2, R17, R18, R19).

Marking moisture areas (blue paint) with arrows.

Marking features (orange paint) with labels (e.g., 1 HV 1, 1 D1).

Damage Marking (pink paint) for moisture entry points (holes, damaged seams, lifted membrane, flashings), blisters, debris strikes.


Test Squares: Input for 10x10 test square locations on each section, total number of impacts (CI=). Ability to mark individual impacts (pink L).


Soft Metals: Fields for parapet caps, measured square footage, number/size of impacts, coping size, labeling conventions.


Tramex Moisture Test: Input for moisture levels, marking locations (2'x2' square, label with Section, MT#, %, 2ft tall letters).


Core Samples: Input for 2'x2' core sample locations (1'x1' cut on 3 sides). Documentation of insulation depth and layers, decking, prick test, pictures of each layer, center cut of hail impact, insulation fracture, membrane damage (top/bottom), pull testing, taper/drainage.

5. Key Business Logic & Data Flow Requirements

"Good Client - Good Damage - Good Coverage": The system should help identify these key criteria during assessment and reporting.


"Proof of Loss / Burden of Proof": The application must inherently support the gathering and presentation of evidence to satisfy the burden of proof for insurance claims.


"Hooked, Cooked, and Cleaned": Integrate workflows and data points that support this entire customer journey, from initial contact to successful project completion and payment.


Commission Tracking: Potentially track consultant commission based on sales production and payment collection stages (deposit, materials arrival, final payment).

Data Security & Integrity: Ensure that sensitive client and project data is securely stored and managed.

Replit Application Development Considerations:
Scalability: Design for future growth in users and data volume.

User Interface (UI): Intuitive and efficient UI for consultants, especially for on-site data entry and photo annotation.

Backend Logic: Robust data models and business logic to handle complex calculations and report generation.

Database: A flexible database structure to store all the detailed project, client, training, and report data.

External API Integrations: Ability to connect with external services like Company Cam, Hail Trace, etc.

File Management: Efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of image and PDF data.

Offline Capability (Consideration): While Replit is cloud-based, consider if any parts of the inspection data collection could be cached for areas with poor connectivity.

Authentication & Authorization: Secure login and role-based access control.
