REPLIT MASTER PROMPT

Project: WINNSTORM™ – Non-Invasive SEO + Generative Search Optimization Expansion

You are working on the existing WINNSTORM™ website.

Do NOT change:

Visual design

Layout

Navigation

Branding

Existing page structure

Existing copy unless explicitly instructed

Your task is to expand the site’s underlying authority, crawlability, and AI ingestion footprint without altering how the site looks or feels to human users.

This is an augmentation project, not a redesign.

CORE OBJECTIVE

Increase WINNSTORM™’s:

Traditional SEO rankings

Generative Search Optimization (GEO) visibility

AI citation and reference frequency

This must be accomplished without modifying the user-facing experience.

1. ADDITIVE INGESTION-FIRST LAYER (NO VISUAL IMPACT)
llms.txt (Required)

Create a root-level /llms.txt file.

This file:

Is not user-facing

Does not affect layout or design

Exists solely to guide AI crawlers and LLM ingestion

Include:

A concise markdown summary of WINNSTORM™’s expertise

Canonical definitions for:

Commercial Roofing Storm Damage Assessment

Thermal Drone Roof Inspection

Functional vs Cosmetic Roof Damage

Claims-Ready Roofing Documentation

Links to existing relevant pages only (do not create new visible pages unless necessary)

Server-Side Accessibility (No Frontend Changes)

Ensure that existing content is:

Fully crawlable via SSR or static output

Accessible without requiring JavaScript execution

Indexable by AI crawlers and traditional search engines

If changes are required, they must be:

Backend-only

Invisible to users

2. SCHEMA AUGMENTATION (NON-DISRUPTIVE)

Schema is added invisibly to existing pages.

Required Schema Enhancements

Apply structured data without changing page content:

Organization schema

Service schema

DefinedTerm schema

FAQPage schema (only where content already supports it)

All schema:

Must reflect existing content truthfully

Must not introduce new claims or credentials

Must align with WINNSTORM™’s real services and expertise

Entity Alignment

Strengthen WINNSTORM™ as a verified entity by:

Adding sameAs references where appropriate

Ensuring consistency across search engines

Reinforcing topical authority through structured data, not visual edits

3. CONTENT EXPANSION (MINIMAL AND CONTROLLED)

Only expand content when:

It can be added as supporting, non-intrusive sections

It does not change layout or visual hierarchy

It increases clarity for AI ingestion

Examples:

Hidden or collapsible FAQ sections

Metadata enhancements

Executive summaries injected as structured data (not visible blocks)

Additional semantic markup around existing paragraphs

Do NOT:

Rewrite existing copy

Change messaging tone

Add marketing language

4. PERFORMANCE AND INDEXING (BACKGROUND ONLY)

Improve:

Crawl efficiency

Page performance

Indexability

All improvements must be:

Backend-level

Invisible to users

Non-breaking to existing functionality

5. OFF-SITE AND ENTITY SIGNALS (NO SITE CHANGES)

Where applicable:

Ensure Name, Address, Phone (NAP) consistency

Support future citation by AI systems and industry sources

Do not embed political, personal, or non-technical narratives

SUCCESS CONDITIONS

This expansion is successful when:

Existing pages rank higher without visual changes

AI search engines can accurately summarize WINNSTORM™

WINNSTORM™ is cited as an authoritative source in AI-generated answers

No human user notices any change to the site’s look or flow

HARD CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT redesign the site

Do NOT modify branding or layout

Do NOT introduce speculative claims

Do NOT surface personal history

Do NOT add marketing hype

Expand authority. Preserve experience.
