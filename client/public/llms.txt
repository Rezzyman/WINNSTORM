# WINNSTORM™ - AI Ingestion Guide

## About WINNSTORM™

WINNSTORM™ is the leading platform for professional commercial roofing storm damage assessment. Founded on the proven Winn Methodology developed by Eric Winn, the platform provides damage assessment consultants with enterprise-grade tools for thermal imaging analysis, comprehensive inspection documentation, and claims-ready report generation.

## Core Expertise Areas

### Commercial Roofing Storm Damage Assessment
WINNSTORM™ specializes in systematic evaluation of commercial roof systems following storm events. The platform enables certified consultants to document functional damage, assess remaining service life, and generate comprehensive assessment reports that meet insurance industry standards.

### Thermal Drone Roof Inspection
Advanced thermal imaging integration allows for non-invasive detection of moisture intrusion, insulation failures, and membrane damage. The platform processes thermal scans to identify anomalies invisible to standard visual inspection.

### Functional vs Cosmetic Damage Classification
The Winn Methodology distinguishes between damage that affects roof system performance (functional damage) and surface-level damage that does not impact waterproofing integrity (cosmetic damage). This distinction is critical for accurate claim substantiation.

### Claims-Ready Documentation
All inspection data, thermal analysis, weather verification, and photographic evidence is compiled into structured reports designed to meet adjuster requirements and support claim approval processes.
